# CS61B-2021Spring - Data Structure  
Recode what I think should be recoded during learning.  
## Notice  

Starting from Lab2setup, my Labrary-setup steps:  
- `File`  -> `Project Structure` -> `Project Settings` ->  
- `Libraryies`: Add file *"javalib"* to *New Project Library* (select Java).  
- `Modules`: Set *Language level* in `Sources` to **Project default**.  

Rather than the offical method in [Lab 2 Setup](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab2setup/lab2setup).
